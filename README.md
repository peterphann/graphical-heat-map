# Heat Map
Finally decided to commit towards building and maintaining an actual Java application (bye command-line programs!)

This is a quick Java Swing application to visualize a 2-variable expression as colors. I've made a crude version of this
on Desmos before, but the limitations of lists and the sheer amount of lag made it impractical to use further.

In all honestly I'm not even sure if this should be called a heat map, since I can't really find a term for this sort of thing online. Maybe someone
can enlighten me. Who knows.
