# Graphical Heat Map

A quick Java Swing application to visualize a 2-variable expression using colors. I've made a crude version of this
on Desmos before, but the limitations of lists and the sheer amount of lag made it impractical to use further.

In all honestly I'm not even sure if this should be called a heat map, since I can't really find a term for this sort of thing online. Maybe someone
can enlighten me. Who knows ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
